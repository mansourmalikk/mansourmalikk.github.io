      The Indian independence movement was a series of historic events with the
      ultimate aim of ending British rule in India. It lasted from 1857 to 1947.

      The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence
      emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian
      National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to
      appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as
      more economic rights for natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a
      more radical approach towards self-rule by the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate,
      Aurobindo Ghosh and V. O. Chidambaram Pillai.

    <p>
      The final stages of the independence struggle from the 1920s was
      characterized by Congress' adoption of Mahatma Gandhi's policy of
      non-violence and civil disobedience. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath
      Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread
      patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Pritilata
      Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women
      and their participation in the freedom struggle.

      Few leaders followed a more violent approach. This became especially
      popular after the Rowlatt Act, which permitted indefinite detention. The
      Act sparked protests across India, especially in the Punjab province,
      where they were violently suppressed in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

      The Indian independence movement was in constant ideological evolution.
      Essentially anti-colonial, it was supplemented by visions of independent,
      economic development with a secular, democratic, republican, and
      civil-libertarian political structure. After the 1930s, the movement took
      on a strong socialist orientation. It culminated in the Indian
      Independence Act 1947, which ended Crown suzerainty over India and created
      Pakistan.

      India remained a Crown Dominion until 26 January 1950, when the
      Constitution of India established the Republic of India. Pakistan remained
      a dominion until 1956 when it adopted its first constitution. In 1971,
      East Pakistan declared its own independence as Bangladesh.[1]
